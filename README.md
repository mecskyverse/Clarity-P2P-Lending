## Basic Idea of this project
In today's world lending someone money is riskier. This risk even gets higher when you lend the money without proof. To solve this kind of problem I have developed a simple Dapp which helps to lend someone money with the proof of Bitcoin Blockchain.

## How to interact
To interact with this Dapp you have to install it in your local machine 

### Step-1

clone this project into your local directory and install packages with 
``` npm install ```
in frontend.

### Step-2 
Go to backend while npm is installing in frontend and replace your mnemonic key with mnemonic of account #0 in ```P2P_Lending/backend/settings/Devnet.toml```

### Step-3 
Now run ``` clarinet integrate``` in backend terminal make sure you have docker installed on your system. It will look like this

### Step-4 

Now again go to frontend terminal and run ```npm start```
open localhost//3000 and you are good to go.


### Note:- You must have a stacks wallet installed on your system preferably hiro wallet.
